# Algorithms-Data-Structures

Algorithms-Data-Structures repo is a **practical playground** for Algorithms & Data Structures.  
Not just theory – we **implement + visualize** how things actually work.

## Structure

- `sorting/` → Sorting algorithms + visualizations  
- `pathfinding/` → Graph search in grids (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, A*)  
- `trees/` → Binary Trees, BST, AVL, Heaps + traversal demos  
- `graphs/` → Graph representations & algorithms (MST, Topological Sort, etc.)  
- `utils/` → Helpers (visualization, data generators, timers)

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourname/AlgoLab.git
cd AlgoLab
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Visuals

Each algorithm can be run standalone to see it in action:

```bash
python pathfinding/a_star.py
python sorting/merge_sort.py
```
